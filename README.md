Week 1:

My project's theme is an exploration of the process of purchasing a new puppy.

My wish list for choosing a puppy is: Female, life expectancy of at least 10 years, adult weight under 40 pounds.

The budget for the puppy is $600. I am interested in Bassett Hounds, Dachshunds, French Bulldogs and some other breeds. I am not interested in purchasing Boston Terriers. I've visited several stores in my search for the perfect puppy.
